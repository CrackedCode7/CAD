- Add in removal/adding vertex data dynamically

- In an orthographic view, how would we go about
  selecting an object (say a line) on the screen?
    - One way this may be done is knowing where the
      mouse is, and checking the screen for intersections
      top to bottom (closest to user to farther away from
      user).
    - Probably need a way for the program to detect whether
      you are close to selecting a valid object when the
      objects are small, line lines.
    - One way to do this could be with a orthographic
      projection using the cursor as the center point, 
      with some fixed pixel number around it.
        - Read the depth value of the depth buffer at the
          cursor.
        - Iterate through objects to find the intersecting
          candidate Need to have object depths figured out
          beforehand, then iterate through a list of depths
          to find if the mouse cursor depth equals the object
          depth.
        - After making sure the depth matches, we also need
          to make sure the object is in the new projection
          from the mouse, so use an intersection algorithm.
